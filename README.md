# COAST
COAST (Cheap, Open-source American Sign Translator) is a non-profit project fit into a wristband, devoted to decreasing the language barriers between the hearing and non-hearing worlds. It uses acoustic wave technology to track hand shapes, sensors to track hand positions and motion, and an AI app to convert these signals to English.
